The code for visualising the single cell RNA-Seq data analysed with the SCDE/PAGODA R package (Fan et al., 2016) can be found here.

To visualise the results of the analysis you should have R and the scde package installed. Please download the pagoda_app_86_cells file onto your computer and follow the instructions in the R/R_code.R script. Please replace the 'path-to_directory' in the command line 'app = readRDS("path_to_directory/pagoda_app_86_cells")' with the path to the location of the 'pagoda_app_86_cells' file on your computer.
